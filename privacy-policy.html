  <h2>2. Hosting</h2>
  <p>
    This website is hosted by GitHub Pages (GitHub, Inc., USA). By default, GitHub stores technical access data (such as IP address, date and time, browser type, and access status) solely for the purpose of secure and reliable operation of the servers. These access data are not accessible to the website operator, and GitHub does not share them with third parties.
  </p>
  <p>
    The use of the hosting provider is carried out to fulfill the contract towards potential and existing customers (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR) and in the legitimate interest of providing a secure, fast, and efficient online offer (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR).
  </p>

  <h2>3. Access Data</h2>
  <p>
    When you visit this website, the hosting service GitHub Inc. processes technical information (such as IP address, browser type, operating system, referrer, date and time of access) to correctly deliver the content and ensure technical security. These data are not accessible to the website operator and are processed exclusively by GitHub.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Contact via Email</h2>
  <p>
    If you contact us by email, we process your information to handle the request based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b or f GDPR. Your data will not be shared with third parties without your consent.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Embedding External Content</h2>
  <p>
    This website contains links to external services, such as our LinkedIn profile. By clicking these links, a connection to the servers of these providers may be established, transmitting data such as your IP address. The embedding is based on our legitimate interest (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR).
  </p>

  <h2>6. Rights of Data Subjects</h2>
  <p>You have the following rights under the GDPR:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Right of access to your stored personal data (Art. 15 GDPR)</li>
    <li>Right to rectification of incorrect data (Art. 16 GDPR)</li>

  <h2>7. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We reserve the right to update this privacy policy from time to time so that it always complies with the current legal requirements or to implement changes to our services.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Web Analytics with Google Analytics</h2>
  <p>
    If you have consented, this website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service of Google Ireland Limited (“Google”), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. The usage is based on the version "Google Analytics 4," which includes IP anonymization.
  </p>
  <p>
    Google Analytics uses cookies and similar technologies that enable analysis of your use of the website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to and stored on Google servers. However, your IP address is anonymized before transmission (“IP anonymization”).
  </p>
  <p>
    It cannot be excluded that data may be processed on servers of Google LLC in the USA. Currently, there is no EU adequacy decision for the USA. Data transmission is therefore based on your explicit consent (Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). There is a risk that US authorities may access the data without effective legal remedies available to you.
  </p>
  <p>
    The processing of your data is carried out exclusively based on your consent according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. You can revoke your consent at any time with future effect by changing your cookie settings via the consent banner.
  </p>
  <p>
